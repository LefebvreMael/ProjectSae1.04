                <p>One of my many interests is space, the stars, the planets, the different stars that make up a solar system and a galaxy. The infinity of this fascinates me. That's why I chose to simulate the gravitational pull of orbits in space as part of a Python project in my second year at Lyc√©e Blaise Pascal.</p>

                <header class="titre1">Moving the project forward :</header>
                <p>To create this project, we used Newton's equations of gravitation and attraction as a basis for our system. We then added star creation, with mass, size, color and speed. On top of that, we set up a png display system based on an average of the RGB colors given to the planets. And finally, a display and menu to choose a mode, change the time, zoom in and out. And so, after 7 months' work, our project was complete.</p>

                <header class="titre1">Final result:</header>
                <p>At the time we presented our project, we had a gravitational simulation of orbiting stars in three modes. The first to generate the solar system and study it in action, the second in 100 random stars mode and see what happens, and finally the last where everything is empty and the user has to create his own stars by hand. This project of 1700 lines of code and 7 months earned us 17/20 in the control, with points deducted for the display, which was too messy. It was the end of a project that kept us very busy, and a lot more.</p>
